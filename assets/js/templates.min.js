The rationality here is that, whereas programming languages and markup generation workflows are generally monolithic (or at least discreetly separated), it is fairly common for frontend application to combine framework approaches.</p>\n		<p>This complicates even a non-scientific calculation of fondness. How does one figure one\'s love for something as plasic as jQuery?
