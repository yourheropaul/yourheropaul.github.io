		<p class="standout">I'm currently a freelancer working mostly under the salubrious auspices of <a href="http://homemadedital.com" target="_blank">HomeMade Digital</a>, a growing Shoreditch agency which specialises in big charity projects. I do my own projects as well. Before that I worked in television, in the pro skate industry, for Australian movie companies, and in online games. I try not to work for large corporations, and I will work on altruistic projects for free.</p>

		<p class="standout push pull">The clients were phenomenal: BBC News, Channel 4, Random House, MTV, Virgin and Virgin, amongst others.</p>
		<p class="standout secondary">Airlock were a Shoreditch web agency with all the aesthetics you might expect. As their lead backend developer, I designed and implemented the approach to every major project, but my most important task to was develop and extend Symphony, and open souce CMS to which Airlock owned the rights at the time.</p>
		<p class="standout secondary close">Symphony CMS is a community-driven, highly scalable, native XML PHP5 application which uses XSLT as its presentation layer. More recently is has found success as static site generator. It was a bedroom project when I started working on it, but has since become a key agency product, and several prominent organisation use it as their primary presentations system including parts of the BBC, Live Below The Line, and Heineken.</p>

I also spent some time building flash banners and mini games for skate websites.</p>

		<p class="standout push pull">Dell computers, Mercedes Benz, Thrify car rental, Peroni beeer and UK telecomms giant 3 were the staple clients of this beachbum Australian agency.</p>
		<p class="standout secondary">They had designers and systems engineers, but I was their only full-stack developer, and as such I was responsible for wiring up the vast majority of their products.</p>
		<p class="standout secondary close">I'm not terribly proud of building the interface that has allowed 1,500,000 Thrify customers to reserve their vehicles internationally, even if the code <em>was</em> impressive, but I do feel a strange warmth at having build the first truly mobile-friendly forum application in PHP, and subsequently being nominated for a Webby award.</p>
