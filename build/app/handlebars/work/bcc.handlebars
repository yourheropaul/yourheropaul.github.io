	<h4>The problem</h4>

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 columns content">
		<p>Breast Cancer Campaign, a large UK charity, need a centralised, multi-faceted donations platform which can robustly accept donations and payments in a tax-efficient manner. Since many of their supporters use mobile devices as their primary Internet browsers, the presentation layer must be responsive and light weight.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="row case-studies pull">
	<h4>The technical solution</h4>

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 columns content">
		<p>The server-side application was a custom Go build, incorporating a complex, highly cached REST API which delivered vernacular page content asynchconously, and accepted and fulfilled payment requests. Presentational assets were stored in MongoDB's GridFS and served by Amazon CloudFront.</p>
		<p>Most of the heavy lifting was performed by the one-page, Backbone-driven client application, which used sophisticated JavaScript (and a bit of Nginx header magic) to determine the correct localisation settings and deploy the correct content. Performance and page weight were critical concerns, so the entire application was linted and compressed using Grunt and several node.js plugins.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="row case-studies">
	<h4>The results</h4>

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 columns content">
		<p>So far, the application has behaved extremely well, and served a number of successful campaigns. The Drupal integration has allowed non-technical editors to manage, deploy and monitor campaigns without difficulty.</p>
