	<h4>The problem</h4>

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 columns content">
		<p>Disasters occur suddenly, often without warning, and the DEC needed a robust donations platform which could be styled to suit a given cause and deployed almost instantly. Their existing donations system didn't have adequate support for PayPal, which is a growing means of supporting the third sector. Each campign must be editable via an administrative backend, and be thoroughly tested and examined before release â€“ with the minimum of technological barriers. Campaigns would often be advertised during televised news broadcasts, meaning that traffic would spike dramatically and unpredictably. Additionally, many potential donors use mobile devices, and their experiences shouldn't suffer.</p>

	<h4>The technical solution</h4>

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 columns content">
		<p>An intricate network of PHP5-driven applications was constructed to bear the brunt of the frontend requests, allow for large-scale testing, and function as preview servers.</p>
		<p>The PayPal integration itself was built around a load-balancing round robin system, which serves to maintain response times at an acceptable level, even during peak usage.</p>
		<p>Ember.js powered the backend system, which presented a WYSIWYG interface for the campaigns, featured a full media management system, and preview facilities.</p>

	<h4>The results</h4>

	<div class="small-12 medium-12 columns content">
		<p>The DEC have, unfortunately, used the system many times to support a great many causes. Demand for chatirable causes remains high, and disasters mercifully few.</p>
